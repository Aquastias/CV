					<h2>Summary</h2>
					<p>
						I am a self-taught front-end web developer with a passion for programming and everything tech related. Since
						I was a kid, I have always been interested in computers and technology. I have always been fascinated by the
						endless possibilities of the web and how it can be used to create something new.
					</p>
					<p>
						My web developer journey started in high school and since then I haven't stopped learning everything from
						the basic stuff to the advanced principles in programming. I believe that in order to become better you
						should always hone your skill to become perfect or, if not perfect, at least 99.99% there.
					</p>
					<p>
						I am devoted to my work and I do everything in my power to output the best result. Beside this, some other
						defining character traits that I posess are honesty, a lot of self-control, determination and persistence in
						reaching a goal and cooperative when the situation calls for it. Also I'm quite open-minded to different
						ideas.
					</p>
					<p>
						My goal is to become a capable web developer that is able to create accessible and performant apps/websites
						in order to help people and businesses. My personal drive and motto is to
						<b><em>never give up and move forward</em></b
						>.
